PAGE TURNER

This application is for readers to save books they have read and get reccomendations on books that they may find interesting. A reader can use the search books tab to use Google Books API to search for books (currently the API is for books about "flower"). A user can also click on "my book list" where they can thier saved books as well as remove them. The reviews page is where all users can add reviews for books of their choice and other usesrs can see them.

Future Updates

- I would like for the google API to be abel to view more than books about "flowers". Right now users can only search the key work "flower"
- I would like users to be able to remove thier review and have their user name associated with ther review
